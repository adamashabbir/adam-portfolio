            How to hit 200% of your crowdfunding goal
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post-content">

            Crowdfunding is phenomenal. It has revolutionized fundraising. For those aware and unaware of what on earth
            it is, read on. I have built a number of crowdfunding campaigns and many friends have successfully
            crowdfunded film, app and wearable projects. However my tips apply to every category.

            Being based in the United Kingdom has its benefits. However, we are fashionably late to the crowdfunding
            party. Unlike the USA, where crowdfunding is common knowledge and has been booming for the last three years,
            the UK’s engagement with crowdfunding is limited and we are typically untrustworthy and uneasy about the
            whole fad. From my knowledge and experience, the concept is still not embedded in society. In the USA, the
            crowd naturally funds crowdfunding campaigns; random people pitch in to fund your project. In the UK,
            crowdfunding could be interpreted as familyfriendfunding.

            <br><br>
            Before you consider pushing your campaign, think whether you could finance your project from an evenings
            event or being human and asking friends and family directly; crowdfunding platforms traditionally take
            between 4-8% of your goal. If the answer is yes, then be sensible and keep that 4-8% and take the campaign
            offline. Don’t be a sheep and get lured into the trend.
            <br><br>
            If your project is bigger, better and bolder then you need to crush your crowdfunding campaign like a
            pistachio. Follow these 12 steps and you should do just fine.
            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="platform">1. Platform</span>
            <br>
            Which platform should you push your campaign through? It depends what type of funding you are after. Below
            are the most popular forms of crowdfunding that have the most traction.
            <br><br>
            1.<strong> Equity Based Crowdfunding</strong>: Investors receive a stake in the company.
            <br><br>
            2.<strong> Lending Based Crowdfunding </strong>: Investors are repaid for their investment over a period of time.
            <br><br>
            3. <strong>Reward Based Crowfunding </strong>: Investors receive a tangible item or service in return for their funds.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/equity.jpg">
            <br><br>
            If you opt for equity based crowdfunding then your choice is between seedrs or crowdcube. These are the two
            most popular in the UK. Seedrs have hosted some notable campaigns and is one of the leading equity
            crowdfunding platforms in the UK having raised £1.4 Million for 27 crowdfunded campaigns in their first year
            – where the average amount invested was £631. Crowdcube have equally hosted some wild campaigns and their
            growth is fairly similar. I would opt for Seedrs right now given their pr and traction in the UK.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/loan.jpg">
            <br><br>
            If you opted for Lending based crowdfunding then there is only one platform to go with. Funding Circle has
            crushed it. They have recently branched intro Europe which has a colossal market opportunity of more than €1
            trillion (£733bn) in outstanding small business loans. It’s probably best suited to businesses that are
            looking for an alternative kind of loan, in fact some would regard this as a peer to peer lending platform
            rather than crowdfunding.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/kick.jpg">
            <br><br>
            If you opted for Reward Based Crowdfunding then opt for Kickstarter. From my experience of Indeigogo I think
            this one is a no brainer. Its User Interface is clean. The Kickstarter community is massive. Their algorithm
            for promoting your project is sound and their ‘all or nothing’ approach encourages you to perfect your
            campaign. As well as this, the folks who work there are brilliant and very helpful. Do it and don’t look
            back.

            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="video">2. Video</span>
            <br>
            Campaigns with videos are 50% more likely to reach their goal. How do you make a viral video? The
            Kickstarter folk say “You can spend days shooting and editing, or you can just knock it out with a couple
            friends on a Saturday. It doesn’t have to be perfect, it just has to be you.” It does just have to be you.
            You have to feature; crowdfunding is about reaching a crowd and there is no better model than presenting
            yourself and your project. Short and sharp is crucial, any longer than 3 minutes is pushing it.

            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="what">3. What, Why, How When</span>
            <br>
            <strong>What have you got?</strong>
            <br>
            The campaign feed itself needs to feature what your product is. This should be a brief, catchy and honest.
            Again, the shorter this is the better. A brief written summary is ideal and a catchy tagline draws in the
            crowd. You have to remember, people are scanning your project, not studying it.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why of why?</strong>
            <br>
            There must be a reason for why you are crowdfunding. Whether it is to go into production or continue
            prototyping. Don’t waffle and cut to the chase. This is crucial for funders; they want to know why you need
            their money instead of someone else’s.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How will you achieve your goal?</strong>
            <br>
            To give funder’s confidence you need to explain how you are going to spend their investment. This should be
            a detailed timeline of your expenditure pattern. The key is to not timebox this to the exact day. Work in
            windows and mention that x milestone will be achieved in this quarter or by this month. When building a
            product there are so many blockers that appear from everywhere and you should add these into your
            estimations.
            <br><br>
            <strong>When are you going to execute your plan?</strong>
            <br>
            Only you know the answer to that and funders will be keen to get a return on their investment. Within the
            feed express your desire to reward funders asap but setting realistic delivery dates will ensure they are
            not let down. As well as setting dates, maintaining great communication with your community is crucial.
            Update them regularly on your projects progress and remember to prioritize pictures over text.
            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="images">4. Images</span>
            <br>
            HD images are vital. Spreading these throughout your campaign feed is useful. It breaks up the written
            content and keeps potential funders engaged. Show your product s evolution and stress how much effort you
            have already put in.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/gesture.gif">
            <span > Glorious gestured gif </span>
            <br> <br>
            <br><br>
            Also consider gifs, these are clever for showing your product in action. Kickstarters aim was to fund
            creative projects. A lot of funders out there are creative so give them what they want and visually
            stimulate them.
            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="you">5. You</span>
            <br>
            Funders will need confidence in you before opening their wallet. It is helpful if you have previously backed
            at least 5 campaigns on your chosen platform. This demonstrates that you believe in the crowdfunding model.
            As well as this, share your history, achievements and why you are going to succeed in building this product.
            Don’t go over the top and blow your own trumpet but give the people confidence.
            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="perks">6. Perks</span>
            <br>
            Tactile perks supersede digital ones. People adore receiving something and opening it. For small
            contributions consider social media plugs and be sure to make them quirky. As the amount you request becomes
            serious, consider how much of your fund to spend. It is tragic when most of a campaigns fund is spent on
            fulfilling their perk promises. The more personal a lower tier perk the better. It ensures you don’t blow
            your fund on extremely expensive perks.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/perks.jpg">
            <span > Various perk options </span>
            <br> <br>
            Utilize economies of scale sensibly and do not guarantee something you cannot provide. For the upper tier
            perks consider face-to-face meetings or an ltd edition version of your product; this is for the lovers.
            Those that invest a lot in your idea are more likely to want to influence it. Let them. Last note on perks
            is to limit them. The maximum number of perks you should have is 9. Of these perks, limit the number
            available, especially in the upper bracket. 90% of the time, when given the choice between a full cookie jar
            and a nearly empty one, we opt for the nearly empty one. It is common knowledge that we want something more
            if it is in limited supply.
            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="party">7. Have a party</span>
            <br>
            On the day of your launch it is absolutely 100% fundamental for you to throw a launch party. Invite friends,
            friends of friends, friends of their friends and importantly family members. This, apart from being a fun
            occasion, is crucial in ensuring you hit 30% of your goal in the first three days. The other positive of a
            party is social pressure. Psychologically, we feel inclined to give more when we are not hidden behind our
            laptop.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/party.jpeg">
            <span > Have a launch party </span>
            <br> <br>
            It is also the very beginning of your community and the more folks you can encourage to share your
            campaign the better. Document the party and publish it on your campaign.
            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="social">8. Social Media & Marketing</span>
            <br>
            It is obvious that you need to optimize these platforms. Be sure to have a page for each. From my
            experience, the key is to not bombard people with your campaign. They get the idea after the first tweet or
            post. Keep your posts visual and always link to your campaign in every post. An overall weekly summary
            status is a must and the sprint finish is the time to go to town on multiple posts per day.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/email-crowd.jpg">
            <span > Typical marketing email using Illustrator & Mailchimp </span>
            <br> <br>
            It may surprise many people to find out that the best form of online marketing is email. I am not a fan of
            email, but email marketing is an entirely different genre. Use mailchimp to import all of your social media
            contacts. There is a simple hack that I am going to share with you. These emails need to be visually
            stimulating. Mailchimp has templates but try and use illustrator to give a bolder call to action. Remember
            to make these emails personable.
            <br><br>
           <strong> Step One: Sign Up for (or Sign Into) Yahoo Mail </strong>
            <br><br>
            Point your browser to Yahoo Mail. If you have an account, you can sign in here. If not, click the Create New
            Account button and fill out the signup information.
            Note: If you want a clean backup of your Facebook friends' email, I'd recommend creating a new account even
            if you already have a Yahoo Mail account.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Step Two: Import Your Facebook Friends' Email Addresses </strong>
            <br><br>
            Now that you've signed up for (or signed into) your Yahoo Mail account, you're ready to import email from
            Facebook. It's really easy to do. If you just signed up, you should see a prompt to import contacts from
            Facebook, Gmail, Hotmail, and other sources. (If you already had a Yahoo Mail account, just click over to
            the Import Contacts tool.) Click on Facebook, grant Yahoo access to your Facebook account, and then just
            wait as the contacts are exported from Facebook and imported to Yahoo.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Step Three: Export Your Facebook Email Addresses from Yahoo </strong>
            <br><br>
            Once the import completes, you can export those email addresses in a number of formats. Again, back at the
            Yahoo Address Book, just click on Tool -> Export (or just click here), and click the Export Now button next
            to the export type you'd prefer.
            <br><br>
           <strong> Bonus Step Four: Import the Facebook Email to Mailchimp </strong>
            <br><br>
            Once you have setup your account on free Mailchimp account.
            <br><br>
            1. Export the Yahoo! CSV from Yahoo. Gmail can likely handle a lot of different file types for contact
            import, but CSV is plain text and works like a charm.
            <br>
            2. Navigate to your Mailchimp Dashboard. Click ‘list’ and if you haven’t already create a ‘new list’. Open
            this new list and find ‘add subscribers’ and select ‘import subscribers’ from the drop down.
            <br>
            3. Finally, select ‘import contacts from .csv or.txt files and upload your Yahoo! Exported csv. That’s a
            wrap.

            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="press">9. Press</span>
            <br>
            Press the press. There are a number of ways to do this but you should always try and hit headline home run
            every time. I am going to focus on twitter and email for now. Nearly every journalist uses twitter. Even
            though it is a dying platform, twitter is remarkable for getting in touch with strangers. The key is to do
            your research.
            <br><br>
            Google similar products find who wrote the article on that similar product and directly compliment the
            journalist who wrote it whilst sharing your product.
            <br><br>
            A typical tweet would be:
            <br>
            <strong>“Howdy xxx loved your piece on xxx thought you might like this [insert your campaign link]</strong>
            <br><br>
            It is a numbers game and not every journalist will bite but some will. You cannot force them to do a write
            up on your product but be prepared when they get in touch. Be sure to have HD images ready and a brief pitch
            to make journalists jobs easier.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/wired-tweet.jpg">
            <span > Impact of tweeting publications </span>
            <br> <br>
            Once you get your write up, whack the publications logo and a link to the piece in your campaign to boost publicity and awareness.
            <br><br>
            <span class="title" id="30">10. 30% on the first day</span>
            <br>
            You should aim to hit 30% of your campaign goal in the first day. This is why you have a launch party. Many
            encourage 30% in three days but I believe the sooner the better. Once crossing the 30% milestone, statistics
            suggest that campaigns have nearly a 90% rate of success. A recent study by Seedrs analysed the different
            levels of pre-committed funds and its effect on the success of a campaign.
            <br><br>
            • Projects starting with 0% showed a 15% chance of success
            <br>
            • Projects beginning with 1% experienced a 27% likelihood of success
            <br>
            • Projects with 5% of their funds pre-committed had 50-50 odds
            <br>
            • Projects with 10% pre-committed discovered that their odds increased to 70%
            <br>
            • Projects having 20% experienced a 80% chance of success
            <br>
            • Projects starting with 35% or more completed their goals in every instance
            <br><br>
            The trick to filling the gap between 30% and 100%, however, rests in the hands of the secondary network.The
            secondary network refers to the colloquial “friend of a friend.” While you may not know these individuals
            intimately, the introduction, referral, or recommendation through a friend is crucial to your overall
            success. But you cannot rely on your primary network to do all of the work for you. You need to map it out –
            literally. Look at your own confirmed supporters and try to tie some influential individuals to each. You
            may not get them all, but securing only a few is all you need to put things in motion.
            With 30% under the belt, your project is validated—it instantly becomes credible. No one wants to be the
            first to pledge money to an unknown, uncertain project. By exhausting your personal network at the
            beginning, you ensure that those in the secondary network are already familiar with your cause, thus feeling
            less hesitant to throw a few bucks your way. The 30% rule is an interesting and merited strategy, so it’s
            worth considering. Before launching, try and pre-commit at least 30% (if not more), either through

            Your campaign should not be static. Have a few surprises up your sleeve. By surprises I mean additional
            perks and positive project updates. Updates demonstrate you’re actively pushing your project on. Funders
            will feed off of your energy.

            Keep a few perks tucked away until that sprint finish to help freshen up your campaign when it is on its last legs.Also consider executing a referral program to drive traffic midway
            through your campaign. If you have surpassed your goal before the end of your campaign be ready to dd in a stretch goal to maintain momentum.
