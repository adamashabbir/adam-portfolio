            WHY I TURNED DOWN A JOB AT GOOGLE
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post-content">
            <span class="title"> J'adore Google </span>
            <br>
            I adore Google. Who doesn’t? It has improved my life. Google Chrome has, for me, made learning how to code
            easy. I have become obsessed with utilizing and embedding Google Analytics into UX design decisions. The
            real-time Google Analytics alone on this article is addictive. A great product is something we cannot live
            without. Googles search engine alone is something I cannot imagine life without it. As you can tell I have
            the utmost respect for Google and the majority of its digital and tactile products.
            <br> <br>
            My personal relationship with Google has been the longest of any of my many digital romances. There have
            been troughs but mainly peeks in our engagement over the years. I recently became skeptical about Googles
            ageing appearance and was relieved when their design team did a little pixel surgery earlier this month.
            Google has always enticed me, for the exact same reasons it has probably gripped you over the years but lets
            not waffle over these for now.
            <br>
            <img src="/public/img/profile/google.gif">
            <span > Googles recent rebranding </span>
            <br> <br>
            Sadly, my professional experience of Google has been less tantalizing. Earlier this month I was headhunted
            by Goldman Sachs. Unlike Google, I hate Goldman Sachs. Many of my friends are willing to lose a limb to
            become enslaved there. However, everything I stand for, they don’t. Saying this, their initial recruitment
            process superseded Googles. I was baffled to read their personable pitch, which differed somewhat from
            Googles, who ignored the first fourteen of my applications without giving any feedback. I
            was shocked when Google did eventually reach out, inviting me for an initial chat.
            <br> <br>
            <span class="title"> Ring ring  </span>
            <br>
            The initial chat, over the phone, discussing my experiences, education, interests and learnings went well.
            Following this I had six elongated interviews with Google over a period of six weeks, three on the phone and
            three over Google Hangout. It sounds a lot but once broken down it equated to one a week. My offer had to be
            confirmed in the States before finding its way to my inbox. This process took approximately one month. This
            was the first issue for me. I was a graduate and not a supremely talented one at that but to give a single
            graduate an offer took Google over 1,680 hours. This made me nervous. If it took this amount of time to fire
            over a couple of A4 pages, how long would it take me to creatively influence a pixel on any of their
            products? Too long I decided.
            <br><br>
            I realize the logistical nightmare of organizing a face-to-face interview,
            however for me it is a very useful practice. Not only do you actually make eye contact with the interviewer
            but you also get an opportunity to explore the studio and workspace. It is vital, from my experience, to ask
            to see the studio during a face-to-face interview. Key things I consider are whether there is opportunity
            for collaboration? Are the people genuinely happy? Is my team a team or a bunch of individuals? What is
            their tech stack? What are their realistic working hours? Am I going to fit in and learn a lot? Most
            importantly, am I going to enjoy working here? All of these are almost impossible to pick up on during a
            phone interview or via hangout.

            <br> <br>
            Before I move on from the interviews themselves I wanted to share my experience of these. Given it was
            Google; I was expecting some whacky questions and tricky case studies. I had heard rumors and even seen the
            films. Instead, I was upset to be asked the typical questions every enterprise company does. For me this
            demonstrates a lack of imagination, preparation and curiosity. An interview should be a conversation sharing
            subjective viewpoints about a topic, project or habit. The aim should be to discover whether that
            individual, firstly knows their stuff, secondly can learn their stuff and finally is just a nice human
            being. Instead I was bombarded with several ‘Tell us a time you have successfully lead a team’ and
            ‘Where do you want to be in five years?’ When an interviewer is talking to a piece of paper with copied and
            pasted content on, you know its not the right place for you to flourish.
            <br> <br>

            This leads me on to my next concern. Once you are in Google, you don’t leave and why would you? It is no
            mystery that working at Google is financially lucrative. It also encourages employees to lead a balanced
            lifestyle having pretty much invented 20% downtime. However, I was advised against joining Google by one of
            their own. Blasphemy right? Well not exactly.
            <br><br>
            My friend has been at Google for five years and is yet to
            progress up their digital ladder. They are talented, young and overflowing with ideas. In any startup they
            would be competing for CTO. Instead, because no one above them is budging, they are forced to join Googles
            clogged up career conveyor belt. This is a contemporary dilemma for any huge organization and one that
            contributed to my decision. For me personal growth and development is vital. Blockers in dev practices pop
            up all the time, but they are fixed fairly swiftly on most occasions. However, a permanent blocker, stunting
            personal development is detrimental.
            <br> <br>

            <span>Tricky to spot the clingers from the climbers</span>
            <br> <br>
            Clingers should not restrict influencers and climbers. A lot of young and
            not so young, keen and talented folks are crushed against this dam of digital dinosaurs. This is why
            startups succeed; they don’t have to deal with legacy products, digital dinosaurs or copious amount of red
            tape. As well as this startups are personal places and everyone should, if it’s a successful startup, know
            everyone else. This personable approach makes learning enjoyable. Additionally, you learn faster when you
            have more responsibilities.
            <br> <br>
            <span class="title"> "You will be set for life" </span>
            <br>
            Everyone I knew told me to take the job. ‘You will be set for life’ they told me. As a base, having Google
            on your CV straight out of University is impressive and desirable for most employers. Well I don’t want to
            be set for life and I don’t need ‘Google’ on my CV to get a job ‘anywhere’. If anything, I think having
            Google on your CV for the sake of it is sheepish.
            <br><br>
            Taking a job for the sake of the brand has a huge
            opportunity cost, mainly happiness. I have too many friends who join organizations for the brand and not the
            job. All of them are unhappy. For me every working individual should be empowered, appreciated and
            influential whilst adoring his or her job.
            <br><br>
            I believe that taking a job in order to get another job elsewhere, a couple of years down the line, is also a negative practice and slippery slope. As we age we gain more
            commitments. These commitments tend to have financial costs. Thus the original job we opted for, as a
            springboard, is now paying well and with a healthy bonus round the corner is subsequently harder to leave.
            More real-time thinking into the situation is useful.

            <br> <br>
            <span class="title"> Ciao ciao for now </span>
            <br>
            Saying ‘no thanks but maybe next time’ to Google was not an easy decision. However it was definitely the
            right one for me and one that I made alone. I thanked them for the opportunity and mentioned my desire to
            begin my own startup whilst working as a front-end developer in central London. They respected my decision
            and wished me the best of luck.
            <br> <br>
            It was a year today that I turned down a job a Google. I can say with confidence that my experience so far
            has taught me ten times more than I personally would have learnt at Google as a graduate. I encourage
            everyone I meet to at least once try and build his or her own product. It is a terrific learning process and
            highly rewarding. If it fails then great, you will have learnt a lot. Also, many employers highly respect
            and cherish entrepreneurship in this day and age, so getting a job will be far easier.
            <br> <br>
            <span class="title"> Fail and Learn </span>
            <br>
            I have failed many times and it has taught me so much about crucial ux design, code based prototypes, 3D
            printed prototypes, full stack development, client engagement and disengagement, crowdfunding and flopping,
            growth hacking, data feedback loops, habit forming products, monetizing, retention and obviously startup
            sustainability both nationally and internationally.

            <span>First iteration of Common Pence</span>
            <br> <br>
            My learning and hard work was recognized when Founders Forum named me one of the top ten young British Entrepreneurs in 2015. My startup Common Pence is a donation
            platform that utilizes Contactless and NFC technology, making it easier for people to give money to charity.
            It is currently undergoing user testing in Australia and New Zealand. For me it has been a pleasure to
            build, iterate and be a part of and thanks to everyone who has made it happen.
            <br> <br>
           <span class="title"> That’s a wrap </span>
            <br>
            My experience should not hinder anyone at all from joining or applying to Google. If anything I hope it
            encourages people to give it a crack and form their own opinion from their own experience. If you have had
            an experience with Google that you wish to share or have an opinion on my decision to do my own thing do
            share it in the comments below. Thanks a bunch and if you enjoyed reading this do take the time to share it
            with your friends.
