                Having studied Fine Art I enjoy critiquing exhibitions. Predictably this years Frieze curation was flat.
                The contemporary tent was packed with oil and acrylic canvases. Given it is 2015, I associate
                'contemporary' with interactive installations that arouse multiple senses.

                Surfing the web is often negatively distracting and a waste of crucial rare time.
                Surfing mother natures web of waves is distracting for all the right reasons.
                <br><br>
                I began surfing seven days ago. I have fallen in love. Admittedly I spend 10+ hours a day surfing
                my macbook. On a daily basis I stare at images beneath glass and casually flick, ergonomically advanced,
                warm buttons. As you can imagine the tactile pleasure I get from this routine is fairly limiting.
                <br><br>
                <span>
                I gained more pleasure from one afternoon of surfing than one thousand hours of surfing my macbook. Surfing is the
                hardest sport I have ever done.
                <br><br>
                For those of you who donâ€™t know the key to being a good developer is surfing the web effectively. I can
                do this because of practice and failure. Now I am determined to master the waves.

                My preference is standing but every once in a while I pop a squat and bust out a few lines here and

                My favorite place to code is up in the sky, on airplanes or zooming through the towns on bullet trains.

                A lot of my best ideas stem from conversations and tactile experiences. Blank pieces of paper are more
